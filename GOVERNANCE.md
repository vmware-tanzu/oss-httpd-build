# Tanzu oss-httpd-build Governance

This document defines the project governance for Tanzu oss-httpd-build, an open source schema to build and manage instances of Apache HTTP Server by VMware.

## Overview

We are committed to the project to not only delivering a straightforward way to build Apache HTTP Server, and all of the essential dependencies including the most recent OpenSSL library, but also providing a straightforward mechansim for seperating instance configuration from the binaries themselves.

## Community

Users: Members, both commercial and the general public, who engage with the Tanzu oss-httpd-build community, providing valuable feedback and unique perspectives.

Contributors: Members who contribute to the project through documentation, code reviews, responding to issues, participation in proposal discussions, contributing code, etc. The project welcomes code contributions to the Tanzu oss-httpd-build project, as well as build and configuration schemas for third-party modules for a more comprehensive build experience. 

Maintainers: Given the nature of this project and its relationship to VMwareâ€™s Tanzu product offerings, the Tanzu oss-httpd-build project leaders are current employees of VMware. They are responsible for the overall health and direction of the project; final reviewers of PRs and responsible for releases. Some maintainers are responsible for one or more components within a project, acting as technical leads for that component. Maintainers are expected to contribute code and documentation, review PRs including ensuring quality of code, triage issues, proactively fix bugs, and perform maintenance tasks for these components. 

## Proposal Process

One of the most important aspects in any open source community is the concept of proposals. All large changes to the codebase and/or new features, including ones proposed by maintainers, should be preceded by a proposal in this repository. This process allows for all members of the community to weigh in on the concept (including the technical details), share their comments and ideas, and offer to help. It also ensures that members are not duplicating work or inadvertently stepping on toes by making large conflicting changes.

## Lazy Consensus

To simplify the progress of minor changes to this maintenance effort, the concept of Lazy Consensus is practiced. Ideas and / or proposals should be shared by maintainers via GitHub with the appropriate maintainer groups (e.g., @vmware-tanzu/oss-httpd-build-maintainers) tagged. Out of respect for other contributors, major changes should also be accompanied by a ping on Slack, and a note on the Tanzu Community Edition mailing list as appropriate. Author(s) of proposals, pull requests, issues, etc. will specify a time period of no less than five (5) working days for comment and remain cognizant of popular observed world holidays.
Other maintainers may request additional time for review, but should avoid blocking progress and abstain from delaying progress unless absolutely needed. The expectation is that blocking progress is accompanied by a guarantee to review and respond to the relevant action(s) (proposals, PRs, issues, etc.) in short order. All pull requests need to be approved by at least 1 maintainer, and in the case of maintainers, preferably not the author theirself.

Lazy Consensus is practiced for the main project repository and the additional repositories listed above.
